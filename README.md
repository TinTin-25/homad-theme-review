Pixel tracking should be set up via Shopify's customer events or pixel manager.

## Debugging

Add `debug=true` to the page URL to enable verbose console output from the pixel
and cart scripts. Disable it by removing the query parameter once testing is
complete.

## Performance tips

This theme ships with pre-bundled, minified assets such as
`assets/vendor.min.js` and `assets/vendor.min.css` to reduce file size and
improve page load times. Keep custom code minified and combine files where
possible before deploying new changes.
