Shopify Aceno theme for pixel tracking and cart debugging.

The snippets/tracking-pixel.liquid file loads the official Facebook Pixel and
TikTok Pixel scripts directly. If you prefer to inject these via a Shopify app,
comment out the script tags in that snippet and document the integration.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository and upload the contents to a new theme in your Shopify
   store.
2. To work locally with [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli), run
   `shopify theme serve` in the project directory.
3. When you are ready to publish, use `shopify theme push` to deploy the theme
   to your store.

## Pixel configuration

The theme embeds Meta and TikTok pixels directly via
`snippets/tracking-pixel.liquid`. Their IDs are now configurable from the Theme
settings screen. Set **Meta pixel ID** and **TikTok pixel ID** under the Pixels
section when customizing the theme.

To record purchases on the order status page, copy the contents of
`snippets/pixel-checkout-script.liquid` into Shopifyâ€™s **Additional scripts**
field (or `checkout.liquid` if you are on Shopify Plus).

The purchase value sent to the pixels uses `checkout.subtotal_price`, so
shipping and taxes are excluded.

## Debugging

Add `debug=true` to the page URL to enable verbose console output from the pixel
and cart scripts. Disable it by removing the query parameter once testing is
complete.

## Performance tips

This theme ships with pre-bundled, minified assets such as
`assets/vendor.min.js` and `assets/vendor.min.css` to reduce file size and
improve page load times. Keep custom code minified and combine files where
possible before deploying new changes.
